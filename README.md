# Voting dApp

## Introduction

This decentralized application (dApp) enables secure and transparent voting on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with Truffle and Solidity, the dApp allows users to add candidates, register voters, and cast votes in a tamper-proof system, ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

## Features

- Add candidates for election.
- Register eligible voters.
- Cast votes securely.
- View real-time election results.
- Admin panel for election management.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain**: For decentralized and immutable ledger functionality.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Truffle Suite**: Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface(under construction).
- **Web3.js**: Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- Metamask (or any other Ethereum wallet for interacting with the dApp)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start Ganache and ensure it's running.
4. Compile smart contracts:
   ```sh
   truffle compile
   ```
5. Migrate smart contracts to the blockchain:
   ```sh
   truffle migrate
   ```
6. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```sh
   truffle test
   ```

## Feedback

## Usage

At the moment the front end isn't finished so to interact please copy the contract and go over to https://remix.ethereum.org/ and paste it there to test out. And also feel free to view the verified contract at https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x455BD4EDa150916Ad1FbD705bE0473dE38721A38#code
